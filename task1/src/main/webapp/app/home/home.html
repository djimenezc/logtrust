                Log analyzer tries to parse log files where are stored the connection information between different
                machines:
            </p>
            <p>
                A logfile contains newline-terminated, space-separated text formatted like: {unix_timestamp} {hostname}
                {hostname}
            </p>
            <p>
                Example:
                1366815793 quark garak 1366815795 brunt quark 1366815811 lilac garak
            </p>
            <p>
                Each line represents connection from a host (left) to another host (right) at a given time.
                The lines are *roughly* sorted by timestamp. They might be out of order by maximum 5 minutes.
                Implement a tool that parse logfiles like this. The tool should both parse previously written logfiles
                and
                terminate or collect input from a new logfile while it's being written and run indefinitely.
            </p>
            <p>
                The script will output, once every hour:
                - a list of hostnames connected to a given (configurable) host during the last hour
                - a list of hostnames received connections from a given (configurable) host during the last hour - the
                hostname that generated most connections in the last hour
            </p>
            <p>

                The number of loglines and hostnames can be very high. Consider implementing a CPU and memory-efficient
                solution.
